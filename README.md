# DAY-11
| Question | Link |
|----------|------|
| **Try-Catch (Exception Handling)**: You will be given two integers x and y as input, you have to compute x/y . If x and y are not 32 bit signed integers or if is zero, exception will occur and you have to report it. Read sample Input/Output to know what to report in case of exceptions. | [link](DAY-11/1.java) |
| **Calculator (Exception Handling)**: Create a class MyCalculator which consists of a single method long power(int, int). This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and finds n^p. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n or p should not be negative". Also, if both n and p are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should not be zero". For example, -4 and -5 would result in java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative. Complete the function power in class MyCalculator and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above. | [link](DAY-11/2.java) |
| **Factorial (Exception Handling)**: Write a program called Factorial.java that computes factorials and catches the result in an array of type long for reuse. The long type of variable has its own range. For example 20! Is as high as the range of long type. So check the argument passes and “throw an exception”, if it is too big or too small. If x is less than 0 throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message “Value of x must be positive”. If x is above the length of the array throw an IllegalArgumentException with a message “Result will overflow”. Here x is the value for which we want to find the factorial. | [link](DAY-11/3.java) |
| **Student Examination (Exception Handling)**: Consider a Student examination database system that prints the mark sheet of students. Input the following from the command line. (a) Student’s Name (b) Marks in six subjects. These marks should be between 0 to 50. If the marks are not in the specified range, raise a RangeException, else find the total marks and prints the percentage of the students. | [link](DAY-11/4.java) |
| **Hot-Cold (Exceptions Handling)**: Create two user-defined exceptions named “TooHot” and “TooCold” to check the temperature (in Celsius) given by the user passed through the command line is too hot or too cold. If temperature > 35, throw exception “TooHot”. If temperature <5, throw exception “TooCold”. Otherwise, print “Normal” and convert it to Farenheit. | [link](DAY-11/5.java) |
